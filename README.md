Weatherman
==========

Finds location via IP address or user input, then pulls basic weather data from wunderground.com

This is a simple python program I wrote that outlines the projected temperature of the user's location for the next 12 hours, along with what it will feel like. Only works for Windows powershell, possible GUI to come.
